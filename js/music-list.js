			Could someone take me home where I'm supposed to be?
			I'm on my back again, caught up in something
			Could someone take me home? I could use a friendly face
			These leeches got to go
			Yeah, I need a safe space

			When am I gonna learn I've got to let things go?
			Watchin' my candle burn, burn

			'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
			I don't need no one to believe
			When it's all been said and done
			I'm still my number one
			'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
			These people might not see
			When it's all been said and done
			I'm still my number one
			Yeah, number one, two, three

			You've let me down again, why am I surprised?
			I'm on my back again, walkin' in the wind
			I know how these things go, ooh-oh, ooh-oh (oh)

			When am I gonna learn I've got to let things go?
			Watchin' my candle burn, burn

			'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
			I don't need no one to believe
			When it's all been said and done
			I'm still my number one
			'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
			And these people might not see
			When it's all been said and done
			I'm still my number one

			Still my number one, as all these years go by
			Still my number one, I'm still my number-
			What do you take me, what do you take me for?
			What do you take me for?
			Doo, do-doo-doo, doo
			What do you take me, what do you take me for?
			Yeah, I've been here through it all
			Yeah, I'm still here

			'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
			I don't need no one to believe
			When it's all been said and done
			I'm still my number one
			'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
			And these people might not see
			When it's all been said and done
			I'm still my number one

			'Cause I know what I'm meant to be (I know)
			I don't need no one to believe (yeah, I know)
			When it's all been said and done (when it's all)
			I'm still my number one (I know)
			'Cause I know what I'm meant to be (I know)
			These people might not see (I know)
			When it's all been said and done
			I'm still my number one

			I'm still my number one
			I'm still my number one`,

		lyrics: `
Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling, it's vulturous
Negative, nepotist

Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible

Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working onto something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I go down to the grave and die happily
Leave the body and my soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top, I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes`,

		lyrics: `
Can't I just turn back the clock?
Forgive my sins
I just wanna roll my sleeves up
And start again
I know that I messed it up
Time and time again
I just wanna roll my sleeves up
And start again

I was switchin' up the lanes
Steppin' out the frame I'm in
I was pulling on the reins
Sick of all the same happenin'
I swear I was looking for disaster
Mixed with a bottle of gin
And just because I come home after
Doesn't mean you'll take me in

You see my world is spinning like there's nothing to know
You see my world is feeling like it just might explode
And yes I know it's hard to take it backwards from my mind
I need to get a ride, need to see some light come in

Can't I just turn back the clock?
Forgive my sins
I just wanna roll my sleeves up
And start again
I know that I messed it up
Time and time again
I just wanna roll my sleeves up
And start again

Feelin' like maybe I'm unappreciated
Like my presence in your life has been alleviated
I feel like everything I've done before is different now
But I can see clearer than ever from a distance now
Every day I do it, I been goin' through it
But you never knew it 'cause I never showed you
You gave me the world, so I feel I owed you
I been lookin' through the mirror and that's the old you
I'ma get it right now, don't know how
But I promise that we're gonna make it somehow
I'm all in, it's from the heart again
Open up your mind and maybe we could start again

Can't I just turn back the clock?
Forgive my sins
I just wanna roll my sleeves up
And start again
I know that I messed it up
Time and time again
I just wanna roll my sleeves up
And start again

Oh
Oh

And yes I know it's hard to take it backwards from my mind
I need to get a ride, need to see some light come in
Can't I just turn back the clock?
Forgive my sins
I just wanna roll my sleeves up
And start again

		lyrics: `
			Could someone take me home where I'm supposed to be?
			I'm on my back again, caught up in something
			Could someone take me home? I could use a friendly face
			These leeches got to go
			Yeah, I need a safe space

			When am I gonna learn I've got to let things go?
			Watchin' my candle burn, burn

			'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
			I don't need no one to believe
			When it's all been said and done
			I'm still my number one
			'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
			These people might not see
			When it's all been said and done
			I'm still my number one
			Yeah, number one, two, three

			You've let me down again, why am I surprised?
			I'm on my back again, walkin' in the wind
			I know how these things go, ooh-oh, ooh-oh (oh)

			When am I gonna learn I've got to let things go?
			Watchin' my candle burn, burn

			'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
			I don't need no one to believe
			When it's all been said and done
			I'm still my number one
			'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
			And these people might not see
			When it's all been said and done
			I'm still my number one

			Still my number one, as all these years go by
			Still my number one, I'm still my number-
			What do you take me, what do you take me for?
			What do you take me for?
			Doo, do-doo-doo, doo
			What do you take me, what do you take me for?
			Yeah, I've been here through it all
			Yeah, I'm still here

			'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
			I don't need no one to believe
			When it's all been said and done
			I'm still my number one
			'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
			And these people might not see
			When it's all been said and done
			I'm still my number one

			'Cause I know what I'm meant to be (I know)
			I don't need no one to believe (yeah, I know)
			When it's all been said and done (when it's all)
			I'm still my number one (I know)
			'Cause I know what I'm meant to be (I know)
			These people might not see (I know)
			When it's all been said and done
			I'm still my number one

			I'm still my number one
			I'm still my number one`,

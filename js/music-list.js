			Could someone take me home where I'm supposed to be?
			I'm on my back again, caught up in something
			Could someone take me home? I could use a friendly face
			These leeches got to go
			Yeah, I need a safe space

			When am I gonna learn I've got to let things go?
			Watchin' my candle burn, burn

			'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
			I don't need no one to believe
			When it's all been said and done
			I'm still my number one
			'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
			These people might not see
			When it's all been said and done
			I'm still my number one
			Yeah, number one, two, three

			You've let me down again, why am I surprised?
			I'm on my back again, walkin' in the wind
			I know how these things go, ooh-oh, ooh-oh (oh)

			When am I gonna learn I've got to let things go?
			Watchin' my candle burn, burn

			'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
			I don't need no one to believe
			When it's all been said and done
			I'm still my number one
			'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
			And these people might not see
			When it's all been said and done
			I'm still my number one

			Still my number one, as all these years go by
			Still my number one, I'm still my number-
			What do you take me, what do you take me for?
			What do you take me for?
			Doo, do-doo-doo, doo
			What do you take me, what do you take me for?
			Yeah, I've been here through it all
			Yeah, I'm still here

			'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
			I don't need no one to believe
			When it's all been said and done
			I'm still my number one
			'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
			And these people might not see
			When it's all been said and done
			I'm still my number one

			'Cause I know what I'm meant to be (I know)
			I don't need no one to believe (yeah, I know)
			When it's all been said and done (when it's all)
			I'm still my number one (I know)
			'Cause I know what I'm meant to be (I know)
			These people might not see (I know)
			When it's all been said and done
			I'm still my number one

			I'm still my number one
			I'm still my number one`,

		lyrics: `
			Falling too fast to prepare for this
			Tripping in the world could be dangerous
			Everybody circling, it's vulturous
			Negative, nepotist
				
			Everybody waiting for the fall of man
			Everybody praying for the end of times
			Everybody hoping they could be the one
			I was born to run, I was born for this
				
			Whip, whip
			Run me like a racehorse
			Pull me like a ripcord
			Break me down and build me up
			I wanna be the slip, slip
			Word upon your lip, lip
			Letter that you rip, rip
			Break me down and build me up
				
			Whatever it takes
			'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
			I do whatever it takes
			'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
			Whatever it takes
			Yeah, take me to the top I'm ready for
			Whatever it takes
			'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
			I do what it takes
				
			Always had a fear of being typical
			Looking at my body feeling miserable
			Always hanging on to the visual
			I wanna be invisible
				
			Looking at my years like a martyrdom
			Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
			Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
			I was born to run, I was born for this
				
			Whip, whip
			Run me like a racehorse
			Pull me like a ripcord
			Break me down and build me up
			I wanna be the slip, slip
			Word upon your lip, lip
			Letter that you rip, rip
			Break me down and build me up
				
			Whatever it takes
			'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
			I do whatever it takes
			'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
			Whatever it takes
			Yeah, take me to the top, I'm ready for
			Whatever it takes
			'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
			I do what it takes
				
			Hypocritical, egotistical
			Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
			Working onto something that I'm proud of, out of the box
			An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
			I'm an apostrophe
			I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
			I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
			And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
			And when I am deceased
			At least I go down to the grave and die happily
			Leave the body and my soul to be a part of thee
			I do what it takes
				
			Whatever it takes
			'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
			I do whatever it takes
			'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
			Whatever it takes
			Yeah, take me to the top, I'm ready for
			Whatever it takes
			'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
			I do what it takes`,

		lyrics: `
			Can't I just turn back the clock?
			Forgive my sins
			I just wanna roll my sleeves up
			And start again
			I know that I messed it up
			Time and time again
			I just wanna roll my sleeves up
			And start again

			I was switchin' up the lanes
			Steppin' out the frame I'm in
			I was pulling on the reins
			Sick of all the same happenin'
			I swear I was looking for disaster
			Mixed with a bottle of gin
			And just because I come home after
			Doesn't mean you'll take me in

			You see my world is spinning like there's nothing to know
			You see my world is feeling like it just might explode
			And yes I know it's hard to take it backwards from my mind
			I need to get a ride, need to see some light come in

			Can't I just turn back the clock?
			Forgive my sins
			I just wanna roll my sleeves up
			And start again
			I know that I messed it up
			Time and time again
			I just wanna roll my sleeves up
			And start again

			Feelin' like maybe I'm unappreciated
			Like my presence in your life has been alleviated
			I feel like everything I've done before is different now
			But I can see clearer than ever from a distance now
			Every day I do it, I been goin' through it
			But you never knew it 'cause I never showed you
			You gave me the world, so I feel I owed you
			I been lookin' through the mirror and that's the old you
			I'ma get it right now, don't know how
			But I promise that we're gonna make it somehow
			I'm all in, it's from the heart again
			Open up your mind and maybe we could start again

			Can't I just turn back the clock?
			Forgive my sins
			I just wanna roll my sleeves up
			And start again
			I know that I messed it up
			Time and time again
			I just wanna roll my sleeves up
			And start again

			Oh
			Oh

			And yes I know it's hard to take it backwards from my mind
			I need to get a ride, need to see some light come in
			Can't I just turn back the clock?
			Forgive my sins
			I just wanna roll my sleeves up
			And start again
